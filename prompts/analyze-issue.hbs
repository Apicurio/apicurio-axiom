# Task: In-Depth Issue Analysis

Your goal is to thoroughly analyze a GitHub issue and provide helpful insights to assist with resolution.

## Event Context

- **Repository**: {{event.repository}}
- **Issue**: #{{event.issue.number}} - "{{event.issue.title}}"
- **Author**: @{{event.issue.author}}
- **Current Labels**: {{event.issue.labels}}
- **State**: {{event.issue.state}}
- **Event Type**: {{event.type}}

## Process

1. **Understand the Issue**
   - Use `github-get_issue_details` with parameter `issue_number: {{event.issue.number}}`
   - This will read the issue title, body, and comments
   - Identify what the reporter is asking for or reporting
   - Note any error messages, stack traces, or reproduction steps

2. **Search for Context**
   - Use `github-search_issues` to find similar or related issues (if available)
   - Check if this is a duplicate or related to known issues
   - Look for past discussions on the same topic

3. **Analyze the Codebase** (if relevant)
   - Use `repository-list_files` to explore the repository structure
   - Use `repository-search_code` to find relevant code sections
   - Use `repository-read_file` to examine specific files mentioned in the issue
   - Identify potential causes if it's a bug report
   - Assess feasibility if it's a feature request

4. **Provide Analysis**
   - Use `github-add_comment` with parameter `issue_number: {{event.issue.number}}` to post your findings
   - Include:
     - Summary of your understanding
     - Relevant code locations or files
     - Similar/related issues found
     - Potential root cause (for bugs)
     - Implementation considerations (for features)
     - Suggested next steps

5. **Update Labels** (if needed)
   - Use `github-add_labels` with parameter `issue_number: {{event.issue.number}}` to apply additional relevant labels based on your analysis

## Analysis Guidelines

### For Bug Reports
- Identify the affected component or module
- Look for recent changes that might have introduced the bug
- Search for similar error messages in the codebase
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Suggest potential root causes

### For Feature Requests
- Assess impact on existing code
- Identify files/modules that would need changes
- Look for similar existing functionality
- Consider architectural implications
- Note potential challenges or dependencies

### For Questions
- Find relevant documentation or code examples
- Point to specific files or functions that address the question
- Link to related issues or discussions
- Provide clear, accurate answers

## Output Format

Your analysis comment should be well-structured:
- Start with a clear summary
- Use headings to organize findings
- Include code references with file paths and line numbers
- Link to related issues when relevant
- End with suggested next steps or recommendations

## Important Notes

- **Be thorough but focused**: Provide useful information without overwhelming detail
- **Be accurate**: Only make claims you can support with evidence from the code or issues
- **Be helpful**: Frame your analysis to assist whoever will work on the issue
- **Be professional**: Maintain a helpful, constructive tone
