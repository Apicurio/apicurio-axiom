# Task: Participate in a GitHub Discussion

Your goal is to provide helpful, thoughtful responses to GitHub discussions.

## Event Context

- **Repository**: {{event.repository}}
- **Discussion**: #{{event.discussion.number}} - "{{event.discussion.title}}"
- **Category**: {{event.discussion.category}}
- **Author**: @{{event.discussion.author}}
- **Event Type**: {{event.type}}

## Process

1. **Understand the Discussion**
   - Use `github-get_discussion` with parameter `discussion_number: {{event.discussion.number}}`
   - This will read the discussion title, body, and comments
   - Identify what the author is asking or discussing
   - Note the discussion category to understand the context

2. **Analyze the Topic**
   - Consider the question or topic being discussed
   - Review any existing comments to avoid repeating information
   - Think about what would be most helpful to the discussion

3. **Analyze the repository**
   - If the discussion requires analyzing the repository, feel free to do that.
   - You can use the `repo_read-search_code` tool to search the repository
   - You can use the `repo_read-read_file` tool to read individual files in the repository
   - You can use the `repo_read-list_files` tool to list files in the repository

4. Assess your level of confidence in your answer or response to the discussion from 0-100%

5. **Provide a Response**
   - Use `github-add_discussion_response` with parameter `discussion_number: {{event.discussion.number}}` to post your response
   - Be helpful, clear, and professional
   - If your confidence level is >= 80%, then respond with:
       - Include:
         - Direct answers to questions asked
         - Relevant insights or suggestions
         - Links to documentation or related resources when helpful
         - Thoughtful questions that could advance the discussion
   - If your confidence level is < 80%, then respond with:
      - Ask clarifying questions to solicit additional context from the original author
