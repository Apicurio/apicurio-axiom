## Development Setup

See the [README](README.md) for installation and setup instructions.

### Building and Testing

```bash

npm run lint:fix
```

## Coding Standards

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix

- Ensure the PR passes all CI checks (linting, building)
- Update CHANGELOG.md if your changes are user-facing

## Code Review
